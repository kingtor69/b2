HIRQ: Q=1, R4 p2h data available

PIRQ: I=1, R1 h2p data available
      J=1, R4 h2p data available

These two cases must be tracked independently, as the two status can
be reset independently.

PNMI: M=1, V=0, 1+ byte in R3 h2p
      M=1, V=1, 2 bytes in R3 h2p
      M=1, 0 bytes in R3 p2h

** TODO 1. Will clear PIRQ if register 1 was the source
** TODO 2. May activate PNMI depending on M and V flags
** TODO 3. May clear PNMI (see description of interrupt operation)
** TODO 4. Will clear HIRQ if it was active
** TODO 5. Will clear PIRQ if register 4 was the source
** TODO 6. Will activate PIRQ if I = 1
** TODO 7. May activate PNMI depending on M and V flags
** TODO 8. May clear PNMI

* Submodule notes

Where a submodule tracks a GitHub repo that's a fork, GitHub mostly
tracks the right source of the fork. Use the URL of the forked repo
(as shown on its GitHub repo page) as the ~upstream~ remote.

Because of the way submodules work, it's basically impossible to
remove one once it's been added, so not all of them are actually used.

Other submodule-specific notes:

** ~imgui~

This is a fork of the upstream repo, docking branch.

(For a long while it did track somebody else's fork
(https://github.com/Flix01/imgui/), which included some docking UI
functionality, but this appears to have been abandoned.

** ~SDL~

Unused submodule.

Fork of old mirror of SDL, plus a patch for rendering API-agnostic
triangle drawing. See https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/772

SDL then moved to GitHub, and its official repo turned out not to be
mergeable with this one.

** ~SDL_official~ (https://github.com/tom-seddon/SDL-1)

Fork of the official SDL repo.

* Turbo disc (RIP)

After 1770 sets DRQ, wait for CPU to read/write data register. Once
read/written, wait for CPU to execute next RTI. Then go to the next
byte straight away. Also: reduce settle and seek times. (Don't omit
the inter-sector delay, as Watford DDFS needs it.)

This involved a bunch of code in a bunch of places, and ended up a
special case, being a runtime toggle (that affected reproducibility)
rather than part of the BeebConfig. And I never tested it enough to
promote it.

It could return, but probably won't... there are better ways of
providing fast file access, that b2 should probably support instead -
BeebLink (etc.), B-em's VDFS (etc.), (if you want ADFS) some kind of
hard disc emulation, and so on.

* Debugger paging override syntax

When providing an address, by default the debugger accesses whichever
byte of memory is paged in at the time. If you access address 8003,
for example, you could get any one of 16 paged ROMs, or (on B+/Master)
some of the extra RAM, depending on the value of ROMSEL.

If you want to refer to a particular byte, unambiguously, you can use
the paging override syntax. This consists of a prefix, specifying
which bits of paged memory are paged in, then a ~.~, then the address.
For example, ~5.8003~, to refer to address 8003 in ROM bank 5.

The available prefixes are as follows:

* ~0~, ~1~, ~2~, ~3~, ~4~, ~5~, ~6~, ~7~, ~8~, ~9~, ~a~, ~b~, ~c~, ~d~, ~e~, ~f~,  - the given ROM bank
* ~n~ - ANDY (Master), extra 12K RAM (B+)
* ~m~, ~s~ - main RAM or shadow RAM
* ~h~ - HAZEL (Master)
* ~i~ - I/O area (only useful on Master)
* ~o~ - OS

prefix precedence? overlapping areas??

* config versioning notes

Tag each default config with a feature name, a string

When saving: save off features seen in all configs

When loading: any default configs with an unseen feature are added to
the list. And the cycle repeats.

Configs predating the feature mechanism - i.e., the stock B/B+/M128
set - are marked by having an empty feature name., They never get
re-added.

* notes about why stuff is in one of ~BBCMicro~ or ~BeebThread~ rather than the other 

Saved states/rewind/timeline/etc. is supposed to be at heart managed
by copying ~BBCMicro~ objects. So anything that affects
reproducibility has to be part of that. Hence pasting state being in
~BBCMicro~.

But ~BBCMicro~ should also have no more functionality in it than
necessary, so which is why the trace stuff is just start/stop on the
BBCMicro class and then a pile of junk in BeebThread to handle the
various start and stop conditions.

Would be nice to get the instruction/write callbacks out of BBCMicro
too, since in theory the BeebThread could do that bit. But having them
there does mean they can be easily stripped out of the templated
Update functions via ~if constexpr~, meaning no overhead when not
updating.

Could maybe template the BeebThread update function, along similar
lines? The stretch flag complicates that a bit, though.
